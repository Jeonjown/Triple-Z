            Way back 2020 before the lockdown due to Covid 19 was announced, the
            owner of TripleZ went for a vacation in Mindanao where they got
            interested in starting a buy and sell of locally produced ground
            coffee from the highland municipality of Danag Patikul Sulu, from
            there they took the opportunity of introducing Alih Kape brand a
            robusta bean ground coffee that they marketed online thru shoppee
            and fb market place, the Alih Kape was also patronized in some
            Muslim grocery stores. After the lockdown and ECQ the coffee
            industries begun to flourish as the opening of physical stores
            restarted to become competent again in the market. In March of 2023
            Triple Z coffeeshop was opened to the public, inspired after the
            initials of the three beloved daughter of the owners Zia, Zaily and
            Zarina.
